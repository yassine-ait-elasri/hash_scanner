# hash_scanner
This Python program is a virus scanner that checks files for potential viruses or malware. It uses the API provided by www.virustotal.com to compare the MD5 hash of the file to a database of known virus hashes.
If there is a match, it indicates that the file is potentially harmful or malicious and may contain a virus.

# how to use 
To use this virus scanner, you need to first launch the program.
Once the program is running, you can pass the path of the suspicious file to the scanner.
The scanner will then display the result of the scan.

# exemple
For example, if you provide the virus scanner program with a suspicious file that contains a keylogger virus
 the scanner will indicate that the file is potentially harmful or malicious and should not be opened or executed.
